# NPC Import Statblock Standard

Use this format for the `## Import Statblock` section on every NPC page. This standard is optimized for plain-text copy/paste into Foundry VTT 5e statblock importer workflows.

## Rules
- Keep statblocks in a fenced `text` code block.
- Keep mechanics only; no lore paragraphs in this section.
- Do not use tables, columns, infoboxes, or decorative layouts.
- Keep line labels and section headers in the same order every time.
- Use recognizable 5e wording: `Melee Weapon Attack:`, `Ranged Weapon Attack:`, `Hit:`, `Spellcasting.`, `Innate Spellcasting.`
- If a section does not apply, write `None.`

## Spellcasting Notes
- Use `Spellcasting.` when the NPC prepares/casts spells normally.
- Use `Innate Spellcasting.` when abilities are innate.
- If both apply, include both entries under the final `Spellcasting` section.

## Where to Use
- Build new NPC pages from [[templates/person-npc-template|Person NPC Template]].
- Keep NPC page structure aligned with [[people/index|People]] guidance.
