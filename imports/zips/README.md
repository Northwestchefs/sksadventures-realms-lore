# ZIP staging

Place one or more image ZIP files in this folder, then run:

```bash
npm run images:import-zips
```

## ZIP formats supported

### 1) Structured ZIP (recommended)

Use approved top-level folders inside the archive:

- `npcs/`
- `monsters/`
- `locations/`
- `items/`
- `factions/`
- `misc/`

### 2) Flat ZIP (quick import)

If the ZIP contains image files at the root (no folders), they will be imported to:

- `assets/images/misc/<zip-name-slug>/`

Optional target/path override:

```bash
npm run images:import-zips -- --target npcs --path core/drow/female/dark-elf-fantasy-pack-01
```
